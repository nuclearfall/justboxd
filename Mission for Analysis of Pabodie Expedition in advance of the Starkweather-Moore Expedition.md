# Mission for Analysis of Pabodie Expedition in advance of the Starkweather-Moore Expedition
## Introduction 
Everyone knows of the Pabodie Expedition is well known <super> internationally for both the research potential </super> and the tragic loss of the Lake party, which was a sub-expedition, <img = https://duckduckgo.com/?t=iphone> </img>
who after revealing that they had made incredible findings at the base of a vast and unexplored mountain range.

## Summary 
The mission is taken without fanfare or celebration, in the wake of public outcry in the wake of the recent clamoring of Professor Dyers of Miskatonic University Geological department, along with some confirmation of those reports internally, by the revered Rear Admiral Byrd, the outcome is a brief fact-finding mission to that remote place purportedly discovered by Professor Lake and his sub-expedition.

The President himself has called for this fact-finding mission in advance of the massive Starkwether-Moore expedition, which will use the engineering principles set forth by Dr. Parodie regarding drilling for research as well as potential resources.

The final resting place of the Endurance
Worsley fixed the position as 68° 38.5’S 52° 58’W

## Principle Characters
### Diana Lake neé Pickman 
Diletante

Heiress to the vast Pickman estate, you’ve never wanted for money. You’ve only wanted for love. As your parent’s remained distant and reclusive throughout your life, you sought through society to find a way out of that purportedly cursed Pickman Mansion. 

You’d witnessed two things at that mansion that  have forced you to question certain understandings who had about the world around you. One was the analogy of a certain trait to color, of a rock kept in a bell jar on the mantelpiece of your father’s study. It was ore taken from the sight of a mine prospect purchased by your parent’s many years ago, known now as the blasted heath, in the hills outside of Arkham. The properties of these rocks match precisely core samples taken from the drill sites of your husbands expedition.

The other was a mysterious order who’d met at your parent’s house since. 

As a little girl, you remember hearing those chants. study. Retelling the accounts of the dreadful things that appeared to you in your bedroom during one such ritual, was dismissed your parents were quick to dismissed as nightmares, best forgotten.

You met your husband Charles Lake after a disastrous ball where you’d been made the object of ridicule after a mishap involving a carriage wheel and a pool of water and a ball gown. While crying, a young man came up to you and offered you a handkerchief. It’s absurd inability for the job at hand had you both laughing hysterically. 

After meeting your husband, you’d quickly transitioned into  a life of Dilettante by evening and adventurer by day. Your honeymoon was taken in Tibet. The altitude had made you both giddy. It’s one of your most fond memories of your husband. 

Your husband was only able to go on the Pabodie expedition because of  sizable ‘anonymous’ donation you made to the biology department. He would never have accepted your money outright, but you wanted so badly to allow him to chase his dreams. 

Your motivation for this mission: to find the remains of your husband, the circumstances which lead to his death, and whether you are aware consciously or not, to assuage the grief and aid in your mourning.

## Captain Johnathan Miller
#### Military Officer
Having setup a basecamp in advance of the scientific expedition, it is to be made clear to all, that no matter what they’ve been told or where funding for the mission comes from, you are in full control of this mission. Your background in Military operations during the war evidence your ability to adequately asses risk, complete assigned missions—even when they are not officially assigned. You’ve been given files on all of the scientists, both on this mission, as well as classified information and materials regarding the previous expedition.

You’re skeptical of the evidence, which could’ve been easily faked by anyone with sufficient desire to be noticed. You saw terrible during the war, things that might’ve made a lesser man crack, but your strong mine easily dismissed them as what they were. Sometimes they were the hallucinations of men who couldn’t sleep, sometimes psychological operations, and most often propaganda.

The only thing that upsets you is confirmation of the existence of this strange location by Rear Admiral Byrd for whom you have the greatest respect and admiration. So, it is those physical places beyond the mountains and not the biologicals that are your primary concern. 

Scientists aren’t to be trusted. Military confirmation is essential to your belief in a thing, and as you are capable of such denial as previously mentioned, it’s unlikely that any accounts of such advanced lifeforms will be believed.

Nevertheless, the safety of all those under your authority, both military and civilians is of the utmost importance. To keep the flock from stringing, you will ensure that every scientific team will be escorted by at least a squad of soldiers. 

Under your command is a company of the 10th mountain division, 42 soldiers in all.


### Mark Jones
#### Engineer
You were contacted only a week ago. Your work in the engineering of the Panama Canal was lauded by the government officials. Though you initially refused any advances towards this arctic project—the thing was simply outside of your wheelhouse. You have a great deal of experience working in hostile environments, but never any desire to work on projects in any winter climate.

The second invitation made clear that your future could be bright or short-lived, depending on your answer. So, this is no real invitation at all. The blackmail is the primary motivation for your part in the mission. Your resentment at the means employed by this man and those behind him, cause you to act out in ways that will definitely be noticed by those in charge, but you’re anger often gets the best of you.


### Professor Singh
#### Biologist
An expert in your field, when arctic biology is mentioned in academic circles, your name is almost certain to crop up.  Now, you’ve been given the opportunity to follow up on the work of Dr. Lake, potentially making you a household name. This prospect is part of your acceptance of the invitation. 

This one month trip could make you a household name. The promise alluded to by early messages from Lake’s party excites you. You’re quite used to the sever polar extremes and you’ve been assigned as the leader of the scientific expedition.


## Jefferson Hart
Hunter/Trapper
The antarctic is a barren wasteland. You know it, they know it. Why have you been called to this place. You were given ample compensation and having hunted polar bears, you’re not in the least worried about whatever inland animals might present themselves, but you find the whole thing absurd.

But if it’s true? The possibility of an epic hunt peaks your curiosity.

## Simone Arthur
### Climber
You’ve led climbs up some of the most treacherous mountains in the world,  having spent the past four years in the Andes. Your primary motivation has always been mountain exploration, looking for new peaks to climb. You’ve been told that you are to lead climbing parties through the traversal of this new mountain range. 

The desire to ascend those peaks, not to lead those parties, is your motivation for joining the mission. 

## PFC James McMannis 
Two weeks ago you’d come back from leave to your unit in the 10th Mountain Division to find your unit being shipped out to the Antarctic. Your company commander was replaced, and a strange looking new officer has taken his place.  Your first thought after seeing him, is that Captain Miller doesn’t belongs in the mountains.

You and the others in your Company are merely following orders. Captain Miller has made clear that the soldiers under his command will follow their orders, and any questions they have only complication their understanding of the objective.

Your mission is to ensure the safety of the fact-finding mission to an undisclosed region is Antarctica. In just one word, babysitting. 

## Skyler Mordant
### Federal Agent
Your connections within your order and your allegiance to the same has given you great insight into what you might find when you arrive. You were able to gain this assignment by pushing on a few superiors who had a few skeletons in their closets.

Could it be that the rumors of your order are true. Nyarthlotep may be able to help your order extend the reach of its power. Your complete knowledge of the situation in this place, and the things involved, means that the potential for an army of Shoggoth to advance Silver’s Order. These fools surrounding you have no idea what fresh hell they’ll experience should you achieve your objective of calling Nyartholtep to call on the Shoggoth to rise and fight. 

You also have a deep rooted contempt for anyone or anything not from within 20 miles of your beloved Providence.

## Professor Jane Dunkirk 
### Zoologist
Your competence In your field is unquestionable, but the academic boys’ club has been a massive hinderance to your work. You hate pompous academic windbags, preferring more a more practical approach to situations.

You’ve been told that new accounts of the Pabodie expedition may involve the discovery of an inland species of penguins. Your entire life has been devoted to the animals of the polar region and this discovery could be the thing that frees you from the shackles of those who have actively worked to diminish your contributions in your field.
